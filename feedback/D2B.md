2.5 / 3

1. The required admin files have been correctly filled in, committed and pushed,
   passing the CI compliance test.
2. The Git log or other material provides evidence of healthy teamwork.
3. Your skeleton version of the game is appropriately designed.
4. The skeleton version of the game has well-selected class, method and field names.
5. Fields and methods are included in all of the classes.

Great work! One thing in particular I want to point out here is that it's not
a good idea to put all the design together. Instead, try to create different
modules and design API as a bridge to connect functions. The separation of 
concern is an important part of OOP.
