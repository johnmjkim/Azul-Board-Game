## Group Feedback
Nice work so far! The teamwork is great from your git commit history.
The game itself is yet to be playable, but I can see a very fairly okay skeleton
at this point. However, regarding the design, I suggest you reflect on what you
have learnt from lab 6 exercises. Is string representation ideal for a large
project as such? Will using object orientation benefit you?
