## Tutor Comment
Hey team, good effort in implementing this game!

Reading your code, I can see concise and clear comment with enough authorship
details.
Your use of javadoc provides me with a structure easy to follow, explaining
purpose of the method and important features of the interface.
Your testing suite contains useful tests of various aspects of the assignment.
I'm really glad that your code follows a sensible and consistent style, with
meaningful names and data structures.
I can also see a good use of OO in your program, where you designed multiple
classes and methods with obvious responsibilities. This has greatly helped with
the separation of concern in your game.

I can capture your excellent teamwork with your git commit history. You have been
committing with messages that are appropriate and indicate healthy software 
engineering practices.

Turning to your game, I find your game quite easy to play with, with no crashes
or hangs.
I believe the modular design of your game helped with this. With appropriate use
of OO, the design is self-explanatory and maintainable.
For the extension part, your creative use of visual effects to aid usability,
with an implementation of AI, makes the game really joyful to play with.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the work that you have done with this assignment.
If you'd like to go further, making your game exceptional, you should try
creative or insightful approach to the problem.
Congratulations on this achievement.

-     * Given a shared state string, determine if it is well-formed.
-     * Note: you don't need to consider validity for this task.
-     * A sharedState is well-formed if it satisfies the following conditions.
-     * <p>
-     * [turn][factories][centre][bag][discard]
-     * where [turn][factories], [centre], [bag] and [discard] are replaced by the
-     * corresponding small string as described below.
-     * <p>
-     * 0. [turn] The Turn substring is one character 'A'-'D' representing a
-     * player, which indicates that it is this player's turn to make the next
-     * drafting move. (In a two-player game, the turn substring can only take
-     * the values 'A' or 'B').
-     * <p>
-     * 1. [factories] The factories substring begins with an 'F'
-     * and is followed by a collection of *up to* 5 5-character factory strings
-     * representing each factory.
-     * Each factory string is defined in the following way:
-     * 1st character is a sequential digit '0' to '4' - representing the
-     * factory number.
-     * 2nd - 5th characters are 'a' to 'e', alphabetically - representing
-     * the tiles.
-     * A factory may have between 0 and 4 tiles. If a factory has 0 tiles,
-     * it does not appear in the factories string.
-     * Factory strings are ordered by factory number.
-     * For example: given the string "F1aabc2abbb4ddee": Factory 1 has tiles
-     * 'aabc', Factory 2 has tiles 'abbb', Factory 4 has tiles 'ddee', and
-     * Factories 0 and 4 are empty.
-     * <p>
-     * 2. [centre] The centre substring starts with a 'C'
-     * This is followed by *up to* 15 characters.
-     * Each character is 'a' to 'e', alphabetically - representing a tile
-     * in the centre.
-     * The centre string is sorted alphabetically.
-     * For example: "Caaabcdde" The Centre contains three 'a' tiles, one 'b'
-     * tile, one 'c' tile, two 'd' tile and one 'e' tile.
-     * <p>
-     * 3. [bag] The bag substring starts with a 'B'
-     * and is followed by 5 2-character substrings
-     * 1st substring represents the number of 'a' tiles, from 0 - 20.
-     * 2nd substring represents the number of 'b' tiles, from 0 - 20.
-     * 3rd substring represents the number of 'c' tiles, from 0 - 20.
-     * 4th substring represents the number of 'd' tiles, from 0 - 20.
-     * 5th substring represents the number of 'e' tiles, from 0 - 20.
-     * <p>
-     * For example: "B0005201020" The bag contains zero 'a' tiles, five 'b'
-     * tiles, twenty 'c' tiles, ten 'd' tiles and twenty 'e' tiles.
-     * 4. [discard] The discard substring starts with a 'D'
-     * and is followed by 5 2-character substrings defined the same as the
-     * bag substring.
-     * For example: "D0005201020" The bag contains zero 'a' tiles, five 'b'
-     * tiles, twenty 'c' tiles, ten 'd' tiles, and twenty 'e' tiles.
-     *

-     * representing the Player
-     * <p>
-     * 2. [score] The score substring is one or more digits between '0' and '9' -
-     * representing the score
-     * <p>
-     * 3. [mosaic] The Mosaic substring begins with a 'M'
-     * Which is followed by *up to* 25 3-character strings.

-     * 1st character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
-     * 2nd character is '0' to '4' - representing the row.
-     * 3rd character is '0' to '4' - representing the column.
-     * The Mosaic substring is ordered first by row, then by column.
-     * That is, "a01" comes before "a10".
-     * <p>
-     * 4. [storage] The Storage substring begins with an 'S'
-     * and is followed by *up to* 5 3-character strings.
-     * Each 3-character string is defined as follows:
-     * 1st character is '0' to '4' - representing the row - each row number must only appear once.
-     * 2nd character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
-     * 3rd character is '0' to '5' - representing the number of tiles stored in that row.

-     * <p>
-     * 5. [floor] The Floor substring begins with an 'F'
-     * and is followed by *up to* 7 characters in alphabetical order.

+     * Given a playerState, determine if it is well-formed.

+     * A playerState is well-formed if it satisfies the following conditions.
+     * <p>
+     * A playerString follows this pattern: [player][score][mosaic][storage][floor]
+     * where [player], [score], [mosaic], [storage] and [floor] are replaced by
+     * a corresponding substring as described below.
+     * Each playerString is sorted by Player i.e. Player A appears before Player B.
+     * <p>
+     * 1. [player] The player substring is one character 'A' to 'D' -
+     * representing the Player
+     * <p>
+     * 2. [score] The score substring is one or more digits between '0' and '9' -
+     * representing the score
+     * <p>
+     * 3. [mosaic] The Mosaic substring begins with a 'M'
+     * Which is followed by *up to* 25 3-character strings.
+     * Each 3-character string is defined as follows:
+     * 1st character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
+     * 2nd character is '0' to '4' - representing the row.
+     * 3rd character is '0' to '4' - representing the column.
+     * The Mosaic substring is ordered first by row, then by column.
+     * That is, "a01" comes before "a10".
+     * <p>
+     * 4. [storage] The Storage substring begins with an 'S'
+     * and is followed by *up to* 5 3-character strings.
+     * Each 3-character string is defined as follows:
+     * 1st character is '0' to '4' - representing the row - each row number must only appear once.
+     * 2nd character is 'a' to 'e' - representing the tile colour.
+     * 3rd character is '0' to '5' - representing the number of tiles stored in that row.
+     * Each 3-character string is ordered by row number.
+     * <p>
+     * 5. [floor] The Floor substring begins with an 'F'
+     * and is followed by *up to* 7 characters in alphabetical order.
+     * Each character is 'a' to 'f' - where 'f' represents the first player token.
+     * There is only one first player token.
+     * <p>
+     * An entire playerState for 2 players might look like this:
+     * "A20Ma02a13b00e42S2a13e44a1FaabbeB30Mc01b11d21S0e12b2F"
+     * If we split player A's string into its substrings, we get:
+     * [A][20][Ma02a13b00e42][S2a13e44a1][Faabbe].
